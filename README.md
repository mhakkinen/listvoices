# Listing TTS Voices available within the Browser

The W3C WebSpeech API for SPeech Synthesis makes it possible to send textual content from a web page to by spoken by a speech synthesizer. Today's platforms come with a variety of pre-installed speech synthesiser engines. This pages will retrieve a list of the local TTS engines. I have noted some inconsistencies in how default and voiceURI data is returned by browsers. Something to investigate.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out to me at mhakkinen at acm.org or file an issue on github. Also, if you are interested in TTS on the web, check out the W3C Pronunciation Task Force.
